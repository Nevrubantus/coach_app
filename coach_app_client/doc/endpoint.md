# Callable endpoints

Each class contains callable methods that will call a method on the server side. These are normally defined in the `endpoint` directory in your server project. This client sends requests to these endpoints and returns the result.

Example usage:

```dart
// Get workouts for a user.
client.training.listWorkouts(userId);

// Log in through the app's custom user endpoint.
client.user.login(contact, password);

// Generic format.
client.<endpoint>.<method>(...);
```
